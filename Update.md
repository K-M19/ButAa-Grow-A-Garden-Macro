## Update Log (V.2.0)
- New: The new macro mechanism can work well with all screen sizes.
- New: New seeds and gear have been added from the LUNA update.
- TRY: I'm still trying to help you adjust the image alignment more accurately, but it's quite difficult. You still have to manually fine-tune it. Currently, the macro can only work on Slot 1 and Slot 3.
- Q&A: Why don’t you add auto-collect or auto-buy eggs? – I actually had that in mind, but I found it ineffective because each player's Garden is different. You wouldn't want to lose a beloved rare combo, and neither would I. As for auto-buying eggs, I’m not a big fan of that feature either—but I might give it a try!
