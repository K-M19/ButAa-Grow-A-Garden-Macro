# 📢 Project Notice: This Project Will End in 3–4 Weeks

Hi everyone,

I’m officially announcing that **this project will be discontinued within the next 3–4 weeks**.

Below are the main reasons for this decision:

---

### ❌ 1. Loss of interest in the game  
The game no longer excites me as it once did. I used to spend 3–4 hours a day on it. Now, it’s barely 25 minutes.

---

### 👤 2. I'm working alone  
Since version **3.2**, I’ve had no support from **Tyep**, who used to help with development.  
All updates—bug fixes, feature additions, engine upgrades, adjustments for macro compatibility—are now entirely on me, and it’s becoming too much.

---

### ⏳ 3. Time is no longer on my side  
This project has taken over **765 hours** of work since day one.  
It was originally a personal macro bot tool. But some of my friends encouraged me to share it with the world—to show that even in a sea of macros, a small spark could still shine.

That’s how this project was born: from passion, not profit.

---

### 💸 4. No funding & health concerns  
This is my **first closed-source project**, but I’ve always kept it **completely free** for everyone.

Many people suggested adding monetization, such as requiring users to **get a key every 3 days via ad-based links (like Linkvertise)** to activate the macro.  
But I declined.

> 🔒 **FREE means FREE.**  
> No ads. No paywalls. No tracking. No tricks.

Meanwhile, my health has been impacted.  
I often stay up late researching logical structures and maintaining compatibility with the game's **weekly updates**, which is exhausting both physically and mentally.

---

### 🔄 Updates Will Continue Until the End  
Although the project is winding down, I will **continue to update the macro until the very last moment**.

As long as time remains, you can expect **fixes, improvements, and support**—right up to the final tick.

> 💬 *“I’ll keep it alive until the final tick of the clock.”*

### ❤️ Thank You All  
Thank you to everyone who supported the project over the months.  
Even though the journey ends here, I hope the spark we lit together will continue to inspire others.
