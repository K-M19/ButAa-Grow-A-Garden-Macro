## Update Log (V.2.7) - ü©∏Blood Moonüåï
## New Features
- **New**: A new macro operation mechanism. I have created an engine based on AutoHotKey version `1.1.37.02`. This will require you to use a 64-bit operating system, but in return, it will run more stably compared to pure AutoHotKey or Python versions, Along with this new engine, the chances of being falsely flagged as a virus will be minimized. However, some cases may still be detected. I'm doing my best to resolve this.

## Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Blood Moon Shop

## New Features
- **New**: Added a new movement mechanism to the Gear Shop, available for all slots 1>6.  
- **New**: Completely rewrote the entire code system from scratch. T-T My hands hurt so much.  
- **New**: You can now go to the Blood Moon Shop and buy whatever you want.  
- **New**: You can now buy Eggs, but you must equip the Recall Wrench in slot 1 to do so.  
  - When `BuyEgg=1`, it will purchase *all* eggs available in the shop.  
  - You cannot select specific types (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Mythical, Bug Egg).  
  - I will look into a solution for this in future updates.  

## Improvements
- **Improved**: Completely revamped the software‚Äôs internal mechanism.  
  - It is now better encrypted and significantly faster.  
  - Reduced the false positive rate with antivirus software by **70%**.

- New: The new macro mechanism can work well with all screen sizes.
- New: New seeds and gear have been added from the LUNA update.

- Q&A: Why don‚Äôt you add auto-collect or auto-buy eggs? ‚Äì I actually had that in mind, but I found it ineffective because each player's Garden is different.
