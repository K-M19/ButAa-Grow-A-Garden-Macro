> [!NOTE]
>  Stable FPS plays a very important role during macro operation. If your FPS drops while the macro is running, errors are 100% likely to occur, depending on the task the macro is performing.
Ideally, should maintain a stable 50–60 FPS for smooth operation.
  
> [!WARNING]  
> Works ideally only when using the following configuration: (Display: 1920x1080 & 100% Scale) (Roblox Font: Default) (Client Settings: Default).

## 🛠️ Display settings
- 1920 X 1080 (Recommended)
- 100% Scale (Need!!)

> [!NOTE] 
> The macro is designed to run at a resolution of 1920x1080 (16:9) with Scale (DPI) set to 100%. I cannot guarantee that it will function correctly at other resolutions.

| **Do Sky & Summer & Onet & Gnome**  | The 'Do' option provides Merchant choices to help you skip or proceed to different Merchants.. |

| Patterns | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| **Patterns** | A customizable movement type you can adjust in the ``Patterns`` folder of the macro. |
| **Countdown timer** | You can choose between 30 minutes, 1–5 hours, or Loop. Once the set time expires, the macro will automatically continue using the Pattern. |

| Webhook | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| **Main Notification** | Displays the activity log of **purchases** and **crafting** processes. |
| **User ID** | Uses your **User ID** or **Role ID** to notify you whenever **rare items** are purchased. |
| **Status Notification** | A dedicated status popup to help you keep track of how many times you've successfully **Bought** or **Crafting** |

| Settings | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| **Play Notify Sound** | Plays a notification sound when the macro is running (mainly for debugging purposes). |
| **Loop-Runners** | Continuous running mode — the macro won't wait for the shop to restock, it will just keep going! |
| **Lock Window** | The "Lock Window" feature locks the window at a fixed position `(X.0, Y.0)`. You can disable it to freely move the window. |
| **Using RecallWrench** | Uses the ``Recall Wrench`` in slot 1 to move to the Gears Shop. |
| **Macro DebugLog** | Creates a file called ``MacroDebugLog.txt``. |
| **Checker-Run** | Sets items in the correct slots: ``Recall Wrench`` in slot 1, ``Radar 1`` in slot 2, ``CommonEgg`` in slot 3, ``Radar 2`` in slot 4, ``Radar 3`` in slot 5,. |

| --- | ------ |
| **Debug Log Viewer** | Monitor the macro's activity in real time without having to open the `MacroDebugLog.txt` file — everything is displayed live. |
| **Skip Intro** | Disable the loading intro, but this will also skip deep verification steps. It's recommended to keep this enabled. |

| Multi-Instance | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| **Multi-Instance** | Brought back with a simplified design, now supports up to 5 instances. I’ll increase this to 10 if it performs well. You must enable DevZone to access this feature. |

| --- | ------ |
| **Recall Wernch** | 1 |
| **Tranquil Radar** | 2 |
| **Common Egg** | 3 |
| **Corrupt Radar** | 4 |
| **Pollen Radar** | 5 |

### How to use (Auto Cook)
* **Fruit Name**: Enter the names of the ingredients you want to cook.  
  For example, if you want to cook a Cake, just configure it like this:  
  `Banana, Bone Blossom, Bone Blossom, Bone Blossom, Bone Blossom` —  
  which means 1x Banana and 4x Bone Blossom.

* **Time Wait**: Enter the delay time before cooking resumes.  
  For example, if the dish takes 45 minutes to cook:  
  Convert 45 minutes to seconds → `2700`  
  Then multiply by 1000 → `2700 × 1000 = 2700000`  
  So, `2700000` is the correct value that the macro will understand.

### How to use (join Private Server)
1.  Copy your Private Server Link, which will look like this: `https://www.roblox.com/share?code=a4258b09fd2383665590b1d5cf0fbc&type=Server`

2.  Open that link in your browser and wait 10-15s, it will redirect to a proper link like: `https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden?privateServerLinkCode=95114022801656566223897662112`
3.  Copy and paste that final link into the Private Server field in the Settings tab.
4.  Click the Join button to test.
