# 🛠️ Update Log (4.9.1) - 🍳 Auto Cook 👨‍🍳
## 🧰 New Features
* **Auto-Cook**: You can cook any dish depending on how you configure the list in terms of order and quantity.
* **Time Wait Cook**: You can customize the return delay time to continue cooking. Use the time in milliseconds, e.g., convert **45 minutes = 2700 × 1000 = 2700000 milliseconds**, so **2700000** is the standard time format that the macro can understand.
* **Added 2 Servers**: Added 2 additional servers for activation key retrieval (America #28 and Singapore #8).
## 🐛 Fixes
* **Fixed an issue where the macro skipped seeds and gear during purchase**.
* **Server Connection Fixed**: I’ve added fallback connection measures to reduce `Code: 0AX-NET-0003` errors, especially when you're in certain countries or using different ISPs.

# 🛠️ Update Log (4.7.3) – 🛠️ FixPack ⚙️
## 🧰 New Features
* **Added DPI and Screen Fix Mechanism**: I hope it's effective, as fixing this issue was quite tricky. I couldn't reproduce the problem on my own devices. This issue is caused when your screen resolution is lower than the recommended "1920x1080", which makes the macro inaccurate.
* **Modules CallDLL**: Completely removed all unnecessary modules to reduce macro file size. DLL calls will now be replaced with ones that directly call Visual C++ Redistributables.
* **DPI, Screen & Windows Version Check**: These checks have been added to the macro to help me assist you better and to help you understand the macro's compatibility. You can find this information in **MacroDebugLog.txt**.
* **Added Onet Merchant & Honey Trade**
* **Added 'Do' Option**: The 'Do' option provides Merchant choices to help you skip or proceed to different Merchants.
## 🐛 Fixes
* **Auto-Rejoin**: Fixed an issue where the macro misidentified images and incorrectly reported disconnection errors.

# 🛠️ Update Log (4.7.1) – 🛠️ FixPack ⚙️

* **Faster Macro Startup**: Reduced startup time to `2.7s` on HDD hardware.

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Fixed**: Error Codes **0AX-DNS-0002** & **1AX-HOSTS-0100**.
## ⚙️ MacroMaker Engine (646.S7)
>Simulates verification time and removes unnecessary module files. The macro will automatically fetch any missing modules using preconfigured Visual C++ 2005–2015 packages. This greatly reduces the archive size. However, make sure you have the necessary Visual C++ Redistributables installed on your system.

* **Trade All Tranquil Plants**: The macro will exchange all available **Tranquil Plants**, and then proceed to make purchases.
* **Donate Options**: A new option has been added for those who want to **Donate**.

## 🐛 Fixes

# 🛠️ Update Log (4.5.2) – 🛠️ FixPack ⚙️
## 🐛 Fixes  
* **Fixed the Click to Move mechanism when claiming Dinosaur Egg**: The movement mechanism was updated because players were standing *on* the lab table instead of *next to* it. I’ve modified it so that when the player stands near the lab table, the macro will zoom the camera to the optimal movement range and continue the interaction as originally intended.

## 🐛 Fixes

> This upgrade works ideally only when using the following configuration: (Display: 1920x1080 & 100% Scale) (Roblox Font: Default).
## 🧰 New Features
* **Loop-Runners**: Continuous running mode — the macro won't wait for the shop to restock, it will just keep going!
* **Multi-Instance**: Brought back with a simplified design, now supports up to 5 instances. I’ll increase this to 10 if it performs well. You must enable DevZone to access this feature.
* **New Checking Search**: The macro now uses a built-in image library to improve search accuracy. **However, you must use Roblox’s default font to maximize detection accuracy.**
## 🐛 Fixes
* **Fetching CommonEgg**: With the new search mechanism, the macro can now detect **CommonEgg** more precisely and will place it in **Slot 3**.
* **Fixed DNS error when connecting to Cloudflare servers**
* **Fixed OpenSSL connecting to Cloudflare servers**
* **Fixed issue where you couldn’t be pinged when purchasing items**

* **Fixed the issue where `Common Egg` could not be retrieved due to conflict with `Common Summer Egg`**: Now on first launch, the macro will take both the `Common Summer Egg` and `Uncommon Egg` and place them into slots 3–4.
* **Fixed the issue with retrieving keys from the Cloudflare server**: The reason keys weren’t being received was because I didn’t raise the key distribution rate. It was stuck at 50 keys/second. I apologize for that — the new maximum is now 750 keys per second.
* **Updated the message `Please open Roblox and join a game to scan the windows!` with a more detailed one, including error code `0P1-PGA-0001`.**
* **Improved debug log messages from Crafting and Speed-Mode for clearer and more concise information**: Currently, `Speed-Mode` is locked and the allowed speed is `MediumMode`.

* **Map Patterns**: A button has been added to take you to a sketch map of the game and the Patterns Map.
## 🛠️ Upgrade

  *Now the macro can detect images, but you must use Roblox's default font. If you use a custom font, it might cause issues.*
* **Auto-adjust Roblox settings**

  *(Warning: You need to use Roblox’s default font for this feature to work correctly.)*
* **Auto-Rejoin replaced by Auto-Reconnect**  
  *With this update, Auto-Rejoin has been replaced by Auto-Reconnect. Many users couldn’t correctly obtain the 32-character Server Link even with detailed instructions, so I replaced the method. You no longer need the 32-character link—this feature is now enabled by default.*

* I’ll be focusing on the core features of the macro instead of juggling extra functions like before. If you want to use Multi-Instance, consider using an older version or switching to "RDP".
---
## ⚙️ MacroMaker Engine 2
### Version: `560.8`
* The macro now uses all CPU cores for operation, boosting performance compared to the old version, which used only a single core.
You can now:
* Use the **MacroMaker toolkit** in the `core/` folder to build your own AutoHotkey commands.
* Benefit from **AutoHotkey v1.1** for easier scripting.
> ⚠️ Version 2.0 of the engine is still under development. Release date is currently unknown.

## 🛠️ Update Log (V.3.7) - 🛠️ New purchase checking system 🛠️
### 🧰 New Features
- **Click Buy**: I’ve fine-tuned it so it now automatically detects the purchase button more accurately by scanning nearby colors and pixels.
### 🐛 Fixes
- **Function recursion limit was exceeded**: The function recursion limit has been removed and replaced to prevent repetition when using the macro for over 3 hours.
- **Server**: The number of simultaneous access requests has been increased, now handling up to 600 key access requests per second, compared to the previous limit of **600 total requests in one second**.
- **RAM**: The macro is now limited to using a maximum of **16MB** of **RAM**, preventing it from expanding over time during prolonged use.
- **BITRAVEN**: Aggressive behavior toward debugging tools has been removed, as it could cause errors after several hours of operation.
- **🐛**: **23** hidden bugs have been discovered and fixed.
### 🛠️ Coming Soon
- **Craft Bear BEE!!**: I'm checking to see if it's doable
### ⚙️ Engine
- **MacroMaker-Engine**: Version `550.d2.Ahk`.
- **BITRAVEN**: Version `Tech 9` - Enhances metadata compression, reduces the number of checks, and increases the number of deep scan cycles.
---
> 🤝 Big thanks to the **Microsoft Windows Defender Team** for their support on this project!
## 🛠️ Preview (V.3.7) - 🛠️ Preview-Beta 🛠️
### 🧰 New Features
- **UI Navigation**: I created this version for experimental purposes only. Please note that this is the final version and will not receive bug fixes or updates—unless I change my mind (Currently, EggShop does not support UI navigation and still uses click-based mechanics, as this is where I’ve encountered the most bugs.)
- **Main**: I’ve fine-tuned it so it now automatically detects the purchase button more accurately by scanning nearby colors and pixels.
### 🛠️ Coming Soon
- **Craft Bear BEE!!**
### ⚙️ Engine

## 🛠️ Update Log IMB - (V.3.6.1) - IMB-Endcode 🛠️
### 🐛 Fixes
- **False Positive Warning**:  
  I have contacted the **Microsoft Windows Defender Team**, and they suggested using a new encoding method called **IMB-Endcode** to build my software.  
  I've integrated this new encoding approach. According to them, it helps reduce false positives significantly.  
  While I can't guarantee its effectiveness 100%, I tested it on two emulators using Windows 10 (19045.6029) and Windows 11 (26100.4351) - both 64-bit, and the software was **not flagged** as a virus.
### 🧰 Solution
If your software is still being flagged as a virus, try the following:
1. Make sure your Windows is up to date.
2. Use these commands to manually update Windows Defender:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender"
   MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures
   MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate
### 🙏 Thanks & Apologies
>Huge thanks to the Microsoft Windows Defender Team for their guidance and support on the new encoding method.

>Apologies to all users affected by the false threat alert from the previous update (V.3.6.1).

## Update Log (V.3.6) - 🛠️ Rework 🛠️
### New Features
- **SpeedMode**: Redesigned speed settings with adjustable options in the settings tab.
- **Anti-Menu**: The macro now auto SyncCams when stuck in a menu with first-person view.
- **Patterns**: Fully customizable to suit your preferences — familiar if you've used Natro-Macro before.
- **Webhook**: Rebuilt; now pings yourself when all items are successfully purchased.
- **Multi-Instance**:
  - Reworked to better and more accurately detect Roblox (only works with native Roblox, not Microsoft Roblox. I recommend using **Bloxstrap** since this was tested with it).
  - Added an infinite loop feature when using more than 2 multi-instances.
- **Made Honey**: Reworked for smoother and faster performance.
- **DevZone**: Added more features for tinkering and experimentation.
### Bug Fixes
- **Shop - Buy**: Fixed bugs related to buying the wrong or incorrect item.
  - *(Note: this wasn't caused by the macro itself but due to a 3px UI shift in the game menu, which misled the macro — it has now been slightly optimized).*

### New Features
- **New**: Time to Bee Swarm
- **New**: The macro no longer requires you to open Roblox beforehand. Instead, it will now prompt you to open Roblox before proceeding.
- **New**: I should’ve done this a long time ago—now every time you start the macro, it runs immediately without waiting for real-time delays.

## Update Log (V.3.0) - 🛠️ UI And AutoRejoin 🛠️
### New Features
- **New**: You can now select items more easily with the new UI.
- **New**: You can use `AutoRejoin` with the UI configuration.  
  Make sure `AutoRejoin` is enabled in the UI settings. This feature requires configuration in the `PSConfig.ini` file:
  - `PrivateServerLink=` is where you insert your Private Server link. Open the link in your browser first, then copy and paste it here.  
    **Example**:`https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden?privateServerLinkCode=452676255653203881808469`

## Update Log (V.2.8.E) - ⛲ FARM COSMETICS ⛲
## Removed
- **TimeAPI**: `TimeAPI` has been removed because ***Time.is*** has blocked access to their API service since May 20.
The macro will now rely on your device’s local time.

## Update Log (V.2.7) - 🩸Blood Moon🌕
## New Features
- **New**: A new macro operation mechanism. I have created an engine based on AutoHotKey version `1.1.37.02`. This will require you to use a 64-bit operating system, but in return, it will run more stably compared to pure AutoHotKey or Python versions, Along with this new engine, the chances of being falsely flagged as a virus will be minimized. However, some cases may still be detected. I'm doing my best to resolve this.

## Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Blood Moon Shop

  - When `BuyEgg=1`, it will purchase *all* eggs available in the shop.  
  - You cannot select specific types (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Mythical, Bug Egg).  
  - I will look into a solution for this in future updates.  

## Improvements
- **Improved**: Completely revamped the software’s internal mechanism.  
  - It is now better encrypted and significantly faster.  
  - Reduced the false positive rate with antivirus software by **70%**.  
- 🔍 **VirusTotal comparison**:
    - [📥 New Version Detection Report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0d30f81311359ff9cac4eaab55b2c4d5e7d65154e16eb8da51741abacadf813c/detection)

## Update Log (V.2.5) - 🐔🧟CHICKEN ZOMBIE🧟🐔
- New: New System `Core.Main.btrv2`.
- Add: BeanStalk Seed
- Remove: Webhook, notify lose connection.
- Remove: System API `Grow.Core.btrv2` and `API.btrv2`.

## Update Log (V.2.4)
- New: The `plugin` folder has been added. Now you can freely create alongside `MainPlugin.ahk`. This is where plugins will run together with the macro.
However, please note that plugins cannot affect the main aiming macro — they only run alongside it.
Feel free to create your own unique plugins!
- Fixed: The spincam issue has been mostly resolved and is now reduced by approximately 70%.
- Add: `Webhook.ini` – This file is used to notify you when you lose connection. Its sole purpose is for that, Like : `webhookURL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123/ABC`.
- Add: `RetryMenu=` – This sets the number of times the macro will retry the action to open the shop menu if it fails to appear.
- Soon: Automatically reconnect when the connection is lost.
- Soon: Automatically join the server you've set up with your own Private Servers link each time the macro is launched.

## Update Log (V.2.3.A) - FixPack
- Fixed: 400ms delay for the Gear Seller

## Update Log (V.2.3)
- Add: `API.btrv2` - An external API library for world time has been added, but it may still fail if blocked by antivirus software or a firewall.
- Add: `ClickBuy=` - You can choose the number of mouse clicks, but keep in mind that the higher the number, the greater the delay. 
- Fixed: Spin Cam.
- Fixed: Can't click first dialog in gear shop.
- Remove: "LICENSE.txt" and "Update Log.txt", replace with URL
- Soon: Automatically reconnect when the connection is lost.
- Soon: Automatically join the server you've set up with your own Private Servers link each time the macro is launched.

## Update Log (V.2.2.A) - FixPack 
- T-T Sorry for more update, this is a quick fix pack.
- Fixed: Roblox window misplaced

## Update Log (V.2.2)
- Add: You can now use 'Recall Wrench' to get to the Gear shop easier and faster
Just go to `config.ini` file in `UsingRecallWrench=0` section change the value to `UsingRecallWrench=1` to use this feature if you don't have it then delete `config.ini` file and try running the macro again.

## Update Log (V.2.1)
- Add: debugMode=1 will always be on when first launched
- Add: Debug HotKey.
- Fixed: objHTTP Unable to connect to server, when local computer is not connected to internet.

## Update Log (V.2.0)
- New: The new macro mechanism can work well with all screen sizes.
- New: New seeds and gear have been added from the LUNA update.
- TRY: I'm still trying to help you adjust the image alignment more accurately, but it's quite difficult. You still have to manually fine-tune it. Currently, the macro can only work on Slot 1 and Slot 3.
- Q&A: Why don’t you add auto-collect or auto-buy eggs? – I actually had that in mind, but I found it ineffective because each player's Garden is different. You wouldn't want to lose a beloved rare combo, and neither would I. As for auto-buying eggs, I’m not a big fan of that feature either—but I might give it a try!

## Update Log (V.1.3)
