- **New**: The macro no longer requires you to open Roblox beforehand. Instead, it will now prompt you to open Roblox before proceeding.
- **New**: I should’ve done this a long time ago—now every time you start the macro, it runs immediately without waiting for real-time delays.

### New Features
- **New**: You can now select items more easily with the new UI.
- **New**: You can use `AutoRejoin` with the UI configuration.  
  Make sure `AutoRejoin` is enabled in the UI settings. This feature requires configuration in the `PSConfig.ini` file:

    **Example**:`https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden?privateServerLinkCode=452676255653203881808469`

## Update Log (V.2.9) - ⛲ FARM COSMETICS 🛠️
**Author Update: k.btyep**

### Bug Fixes

## Update Log (V.2.8.E) - ⛲ FARM COSMETICS ⛲
## Removed
- **TimeAPI**: `TimeAPI` has been removed because ***Time.is*** has blocked access to their API service since May 20.
The macro will now rely on your device’s local time.

## Update Log (V.2.7) - 🩸Blood Moon🌕
## New Features
- **New**: A new macro operation mechanism. I have created an engine based on AutoHotKey version `1.1.37.02`. This will require you to use a 64-bit operating system, but in return, it will run more stably compared to pure AutoHotKey or Python versions, Along with this new engine, the chances of being falsely flagged as a virus will be minimized. However, some cases may still be detected. I'm doing my best to resolve this.

## Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Blood Moon Shop

## Update Log (V.2.6) - 🩸Blood Moon🌕
## New Features
- **New**: Added a new movement mechanism to the Gear Shop, available for all slots 1>6.  
- **New**: Completely rewrote the entire code system from scratch. T-T My hands hurt so much.  
- **New**: You can now go to the Blood Moon Shop and buy whatever you want.  
- **New**: You can now buy Eggs, but you must equip the Recall Wrench in slot 1 to do so.  
  - When `BuyEgg=1`, it will purchase *all* eggs available in the shop.  
  - You cannot select specific types (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Mythical, Bug Egg).  
  - I will look into a solution for this in future updates.  

## Improvements
- **Improved**: Completely revamped the software’s internal mechanism.  
  - It is now better encrypted and significantly faster.  
  - Reduced the false positive rate with antivirus software by **70%**.  
- 🔍 **VirusTotal comparison**:
    - [📥 New Version Detection Report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0d30f81311359ff9cac4eaab55b2c4d5e7d65154e16eb8da51741abacadf813c/detection)

However, please note that plugins cannot affect the main aiming macro — they only run alongside it.
Feel free to create your own unique plugins!
- Fixed: The spincam issue has been mostly resolved and is now reduced by approximately 70%.
- Add: `Webhook.ini` – This file is used to notify you when you lose connection. Its sole purpose is for that, Like : `webhookURL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123/ABC`.
- Add: `RetryMenu=` – This sets the number of times the macro will retry the action to open the shop menu if it fails to appear.
- Soon: Automatically reconnect when the connection is lost.
- Soon: Automatically join the server you've set up with your own Private Servers link each time the macro is launched.

## Update Log (V.2.3.A) - FixPack
- Fixed: 400ms delay for the Gear Seller

- Add: `API.btrv2` - An external API library for world time has been added, but it may still fail if blocked by antivirus software or a firewall.
- Add: `ClickBuy=` - You can choose the number of mouse clicks, but keep in mind that the higher the number, the greater the delay. 
- Fixed: Spin Cam.
- Fixed: Can't click first dialog in gear shop.
- Remove: "LICENSE.txt" and "Update Log.txt", replace with URL
- Soon: Automatically reconnect when the connection is lost.

- T-T Sorry for more update, this is a quick fix pack.
- Fixed: Roblox window misplaced

## Update Log (V.2.2)
- Add: You can now use 'Recall Wrench' to get to the Gear shop easier and faster
Just go to `config.ini` file in `UsingRecallWrench=0` section change the value to `UsingRecallWrench=1` to use this feature if you don't have it then delete `config.ini` file and try running the macro again.

## Update Log (V.2.0)
- New: The new macro mechanism can work well with all screen sizes.
- New: New seeds and gear have been added from the LUNA update.
- TRY: I'm still trying to help you adjust the image alignment more accurately, but it's quite difficult. You still have to manually fine-tune it. Currently, the macro can only work on Slot 1 and Slot 3.
- Q&A: Why don’t you add auto-collect or auto-buy eggs? – I actually had that in mind, but I found it ineffective because each player's Garden is different. You wouldn't want to lose a beloved rare combo, and neither would I. As for auto-buying eggs, I’m not a big fan of that feature either—but I might give it a try!
