# 📢 Project Notice: This Project Will End in 3–4 Weeks 🤔

**🗓️ Estimated Shutdown Date: July 15–22, 2025** 🤔🤔🤔
* [Why?](https://github.com/K-M19/ButAa-Grow-A-Garden-Macro/blob/main/Why.md)
----

## 🖥️ Operating System
✅ - Windows 10/11 64-bit  
❌ - Windows 7/8/8.1 or (Win 10 - 32-bit)  
❌ - ARM64
❌ - Linux

---

## 🧠 Before You Start
- Roblox must be **opened in windowed mode** before the macro starts.
- No Need Off **Windows Defender**
- Microsoft Store Roblox is not supported.
- Use the official Roblox from **Roblox.com** instead.

  
## 🖥️Multi-instances🖥️
- **Multi-instances are no longer supported** because they significantly increase my workload with each bug fix and update.  
However, you can still check out the last release that supported [Multi-instances](https://github.com/K-M19/ButAa-Grow-A-Garden-Macro/releases/tag/V3.8).
- In the new update, Roblox has started to combat multi-instance usage (most likely due to bot farming),  
so I recommend using **RDP** instead, it can bypass this limitation and allows background macroing.  
Sooo... **WHY NOT?**
- I will not guide or assist you on how to use **RDP**, you’ll have to figure it out yourself.
  
## ⚙️ Roblox Settings
- Shift Lock: **OFF**
- Camera Mode: **Default**
- Movement Mode: **Default**
- Roblox Font: **Default** (Need!!)
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  Stable FPS plays a very important role during macro operation. If your FPS drops while the macro is running, errors are 100% likely to occur, depending on the task the macro is performing.
Ideally, should maintain a stable 50–60 FPS for smooth operation.
  
## 🛠️ Display settings
- 1920 X 1080 (Recommended)
- 100% Scale (Need!!)

> [!WARNING]  
> The macro is designed to run at a resolution of 1920x1080 (16:9) with Scale (DPI) set to 100%. I cannot guarantee that it will function correctly at other resolutions.

## 🛡️ DRM / Antivirus Notice
> Some antivirus software may detect this macro as a **false positive**.  
> That’s because it’s protected with **Bitraven DRM**, which prevents reverse engineering.  
> Bitraven is designed to safeguard `.exe` and `.btrv` files.  
> It’s not malware — it’s just extremely private about what it does. 😉

## ⚙️ MacroMaker Engine
> This macro is built using the **MacroMaker Engine** — a modified and enhanced version of AutoHotkey. The engine has been optimized for better performance, includes new features, and is integrated with Python for advanced automation and flexibility.

* You can download the engine here: [MacroMaker Engine](https://github.com/FurBox-Studio/ToolKit-MacroMaker-Engine)

## 🛡️ Microsoft Windows Defender Team  & Cloudflare ☁️
> 🛡️ I sincerely thank the **Microsoft Windows Defender Team** for ensuring that this macro can run safely on **Windows 10 and 11** systems.  
> *(Please make sure your Windows Defender is updated to the latest version to ensure full compatibility, if necessary.)*

> ☁️ Special thanks to **Cloudflare** for supporting DDoS mitigation strategies and helping optimize key delivery routes closest to each user.

Alternatively, you can use Command Prompt with administrator privileges and run the following commands to update **Windows Defender**:
- `cd c:\Program Files\Windows Defender`
- `MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures`
- `MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate`

### 📦 Other Macro Features

- **ColorVEgg**: is an advanced image recognition feature.  
  It analyzes the image and closely matches the color of the creature inside the Egg more accurately.  
  You can increase or decrease its value — the maximum is `100`.

- **Patterns**: A customizable movement type you can adjust in the ``Patterns`` folder of the macro.

- **Using RecallWrench**: Uses the ``Recall Wrench`` in slot 1 to move to the Gears Shop.

- **Macro DebugLog**: Creates a file called ``MacroDebugLog.txt``.

- **Play Notify Sound**: Plays a notification sound when the macro is running (mainly for debugging purposes).

- **Checker-Run**: Sets items in the correct slots: ``Recall Wrench`` in slot 1, ``Radar Pollen`` in slot 2, and a ``Random Item`` in slot 3.

- **Save-Times**: It helps you return to the EggShop, Crafting, or Event every 30 minutes.

- **Anti-Menu**: Prevents the macro from accidentally switching to first-person view when a menu causes a glitch.

- **DevZone**: Access the developer tab for testing and debugging. *(Some values should not be changed unless you understand them. If you've accidentally changed something and don't remember the original value, delete the Config folder and re-run the macro.)*
