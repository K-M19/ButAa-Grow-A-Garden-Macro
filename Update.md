# 🛠️ Update Log (5.0) - 🖥️ Multi-Resolution Support 🖥️
### Game Version - ID: 1714
> I hope this will make more people satisfied, though I still can’t guarantee it will work completely stably.
  This is because the testing environment has always been on newer devices, with an average resolution of 1920×1080.
## 🧰 New Features
* **Support for multiple resolutions**: Supported resolutions include:
  - 1024 × 768
  - 1128 × 634

* **Terms of Use window interface**: This is intended to protect my work and is part of the user's responsibility.

Therefore, I will integrate it directly into the software.
* **Reworked mouse operation mechanism**: Redesigned to better support different screen sizes.
* **Reworked event area walking mechanism**: The new movement system for the Cook event area now requires less walking distance and fewer inputs, but note that you must align parallel to the cooking pot and tilt the camera 40 degrees.
## ⌛ Soon

## ⚙️ MacroMaker Engine II (778.1)
  * **Upgraded the Engine to version 2, reducing input lag, expanding operational scope, and deeply optimizing performance. I had wanted to apply this version for a long time, but it required L Cache, so I postponed it until now.**

## 🧰 New Features
* **Auto-Cook**: You can cook any dish depending on how you configure the list in terms of order and quantity.
* **Time Wait Cook**: You can customize the return delay time to continue cooking. Use the time in milliseconds, e.g., convert **45 minutes = 2700 × 1000 = 2700000 milliseconds**, so **2700000** is the standard time format that the macro can understand.
* **Added 2 Servers**: Added 2 additional servers for activation key retrieval (America #28 and Singapore #8).
## 🐛 Fixes
* **Fixed an issue where the macro skipped seeds and gear during purchase**.

# 🛠️ Update Log (4.7.3) – 🛠️ FixPack ⚙️
## 🧰 New Features
* **Added DPI and Screen Fix Mechanism**: I hope it's effective, as fixing this issue was quite tricky. I couldn't reproduce the problem on my own devices. This issue is caused when your screen resolution is lower than the recommended "1920x1080", which makes the macro inaccurate.
* **Modules CallDLL**: Completely removed all unnecessary modules to reduce macro file size. DLL calls will now be replaced with ones that directly call Visual C++ Redistributables.
* **DPI, Screen & Windows Version Check**: These checks have been added to the macro to help me assist you better and to help you understand the macro's compatibility. You can find this information in **MacroDebugLog.txt**.
* **Added Onet Merchant & Honey Trade**

# 🛠️ Update Log (4.7.1) – 🛠️ FixPack ⚙️

## ⚙️ MacroMaker Engine (646.S7)
>Simulates verification time and removes unnecessary module files. The macro will automatically fetch any missing modules using preconfigured Visual C++ 2005–2015 packages. This greatly reduces the archive size. However, make sure you have the necessary Visual C++ Redistributables installed on your system.

## 🐛 Fixes
* **Fixed Status Notification bugs**:

## 🐛 Fixes  
* **Fixed the Click to Move mechanism when claiming Dinosaur Egg**: The movement mechanism was updated because players were standing *on* the lab table instead of *next to* it. I’ve modified it so that when the player stands near the lab table, the macro will zoom the camera to the optimal movement range and continue the interaction as originally intended.

## 🧰 New Features
* **Harvest (All Times)**: This has been integrated. If you enable both **Summer Harvest** and **Harvest (All Times)**, the macro will skip the time condition and will always go to the zone and place the fruits in the cart on every run.
## 🐛 Fixes

## 🧰 New Features
* **Loop-Runners**: Continuous running mode — the macro won't wait for the shop to restock, it will just keep going!
* **Multi-Instance**: Brought back with a simplified design, now supports up to 5 instances. I’ll increase this to 10 if it performs well. You must enable DevZone to access this feature.
* **New Checking Search**: The macro now uses a built-in image library to improve search accuracy. **However, you must use Roblox’s default font to maximize detection accuracy.**
## 🐛 Fixes
* **Fetching CommonEgg**: With the new search mechanism, the macro can now detect **CommonEgg** more precisely and will place it in **Slot 3**.
* **Fixed DNS error when connecting to Cloudflare servers**
* **Fixed OpenSSL connecting to Cloudflare servers**
* **Fixed issue where you couldn’t be pinged when purchasing items**

* **Fixed the issue with retrieving keys from the Cloudflare server**: The reason keys weren’t being received was because I didn’t raise the key distribution rate. It was stuck at 50 keys/second. I apologize for that — the new maximum is now 750 keys per second.
* **Updated the message `Please open Roblox and join a game to scan the windows!` with a more detailed one, including error code `0P1-PGA-0001`.**
* **Improved debug log messages from Crafting and Speed-Mode for clearer and more concise information**: Currently, `Speed-Mode` is locked and the allowed speed is `MediumMode`.
* **Added a button linking the `List of Donors` to the `Discord` server.**

# 🛠️ Update Log (4.1) – 🛠️ Upgrade Pack 🛠️
> [!WARNING]  
> This upgrade works ideally only when using the following configuration: (Display: 1920x1080 & 100% Scale) (Roblox Font: Default).
### 🐱 New Cat!
## 🧰 New Features
* **Debug Log Viewer**: This is a new debug inspection tool that displays a real-time debug window, making it easier for you and me to track down errors.  
  *You can find this feature in the Developer-Zone.*
* **Map Patterns**: A button has been added to take you to a sketch map of the game and the Patterns Map.
## 🛠️ Upgrade
* **Improved image recognition**  
  *Now the macro can detect images, but you must use Roblox's default font. If you use a custom font, it might cause issues.*
* **Auto-adjust Roblox settings**  
  *With this new image recognition capability, the macro reduces incorrect mode detection. It will now automatically set the required parameters on each run, eliminating configuration issues.*  
  *(Warning: You need to use Roblox’s default font for this feature to work correctly.)*
* **Auto-Rejoin replaced by Auto-Reconnect**  
  *With this update, Auto-Rejoin has been replaced by Auto-Reconnect. Many users couldn’t correctly obtain the 32-character Server Link even with detailed instructions, so I replaced the method. You no longer need the 32-character link—this feature is now enabled by default.*
## 🐛 Bug Fixes
* **Reclaimer Crafting**: Fixed an issue with incorrect items being used during crafting, related to locating the Common Egg.
* **Unable to end search**: Resolved the issue where searches couldn’t be completed by simulating an `Enter` key press after each search.
## ⚙️ MacroMaker Engine (608.L2)
*Enhanced recognition and image scanning across multiple threads.*

## 🛠️ Update Log (V.3.7) - 🛠️ New purchase checking system 🛠️
### 🧰 New Features
- **Click Buy**: I’ve fine-tuned it so it now automatically detects the purchase button more accurately by scanning nearby colors and pixels.
### 🐛 Fixes
- **Function recursion limit was exceeded**: The function recursion limit has been removed and replaced to prevent repetition when using the macro for over 3 hours.
- **Server**: The number of simultaneous access requests has been increased, now handling up to 600 key access requests per second, compared to the previous limit of **600 total requests in one second**.
- **RAM**: The macro is now limited to using a maximum of **16MB** of **RAM**, preventing it from expanding over time during prolonged use.
- **BITRAVEN**: Aggressive behavior toward debugging tools has been removed, as it could cause errors after several hours of operation.
- **🐛**: **23** hidden bugs have been discovered and fixed.
### 🛠️ Coming Soon
- **Craft Bear BEE!!**: I'm checking to see if it's doable
### ⚙️ Engine
- **MacroMaker-Engine**: Version `550.d2.Ahk`.

## 🛠️ Update Log IMB - (V.3.6.1) - IMB-Endcode 🛠️
### 🐛 Fixes
- **False Positive Warning**:  
  I have contacted the **Microsoft Windows Defender Team**, and they suggested using a new encoding method called **IMB-Endcode** to build my software.  
  I've integrated this new encoding approach. According to them, it helps reduce false positives significantly.  
  While I can't guarantee its effectiveness 100%, I tested it on two emulators using Windows 10 (19045.6029) and Windows 11 (26100.4351) - both 64-bit, and the software was **not flagged** as a virus.
### 🧰 Solution
If your software is still being flagged as a virus, try the following:
1. Make sure your Windows is up to date.
2. Use these commands to manually update Windows Defender:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender"
   MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures
   MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate
### 🙏 Thanks & Apologies
>Huge thanks to the Microsoft Windows Defender Team for their guidance and support on the new encoding method.

>Apologies to all users affected by the false threat alert from the previous update (V.3.6.1).

## Update Log (V.3.6) - 🛠️ Rework 🛠️
### New Features
- **SpeedMode**: Redesigned speed settings with adjustable options in the settings tab.
- **Anti-Menu**: The macro now auto SyncCams when stuck in a menu with first-person view.
- **Patterns**: Fully customizable to suit your preferences — familiar if you've used Natro-Macro before.
- **Webhook**: Rebuilt; now pings yourself when all items are successfully purchased.
- **Multi-Instance**:
  - Reworked to better and more accurately detect Roblox (only works with native Roblox, not Microsoft Roblox. I recommend using **Bloxstrap** since this was tested with it).
  - Added an infinite loop feature when using more than 2 multi-instances.
- **Made Honey**: Reworked for smoother and faster performance.
- **DevZone**: Added more features for tinkering and experimentation.
### Bug Fixes
- **Shop - Buy**: Fixed bugs related to buying the wrong or incorrect item.
  - *(Note: this wasn't caused by the macro itself but due to a 3px UI shift in the game menu, which misled the macro — it has now been slightly optimized).*

## Update Log (V.2.7) - 🩸Blood Moon🌕
## New Features
- **New**: A new macro operation mechanism. I have created an engine based on AutoHotKey version `1.1.37.02`. This will require you to use a 64-bit operating system, but in return, it will run more stably compared to pure AutoHotKey or Python versions, Along with this new engine, the chances of being falsely flagged as a virus will be minimized. However, some cases may still be detected. I'm doing my best to resolve this.

## Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Blood Moon Shop

## Update Log (V.2.0)
- New: The new macro mechanism can work well with all screen sizes.
- New: New seeds and gear have been added from the LUNA update.
- TRY: I'm still trying to help you adjust the image alignment more accurately, but it's quite difficult. You still have to manually fine-tune it. Currently, the macro can only work on Slot 1 and Slot 3.
- Q&A: Why don’t you add auto-collect or auto-buy eggs? – I actually had that in mind, but I found it ineffective because each player's Garden is different. You wouldn't want to lose a beloved rare combo, and neither would I. As for auto-buying eggs, I’m not a big fan of that feature either—but I might give it a try!
