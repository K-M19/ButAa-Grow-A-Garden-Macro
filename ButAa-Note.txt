### Note:
Hello everyone,  
I’d like to officially announce that from now on there will be no more updates, bug fixes, or upgrades for this macro.  

I understand this may disappoint or upset some people, but I truly want to bring this project to an end here. I reached out to some of my former collaborators to see if they wanted to continue developing it, but most declined. So I’ve decided to officially close the project.  

I sincerely thank everyone who has accompanied and supported me throughout these past months.    
Thank you to those who contributed ideas, reported bugs, and supported the project.  
And thank you to everyone who used the macro – you are truly amazing.  

I deeply appreciate it.  
I hope that in the future, other creators, whether small or large, will continue building and bring even better, feature-rich macros that meet the expectations of the community.

Once again, thank you all.  
With respect
