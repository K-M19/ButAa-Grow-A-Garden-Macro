### How to use (Auto Cook)
* **Fruit Name**: Enter the names of the ingredients you want to cook.  
  For example, if you want to cook a Cake, just configure it like this:  
  `Banana, Bone Blossom, Bone Blossom, Bone Blossom, Bone Blossom` ‚Äî  
  which means 1x Banana and 4x Bone Blossom.

* **Time Wait**: Enter the delay time before cooking resumes.  
  For example, if the dish takes 45 minutes to cook:  
  Convert 45 minutes to seconds ‚Üí `2700`  
  Then multiply by 1000 ‚Üí `2700 √ó 1000 = 2700000`  
  So, `2700000` is the correct value that the macro will understand.

* **Cook-Only**: The *Cook-Only* feature has been added. If you only want 
  to cook without using other features, simply go to the cooking area,  
  align yourself with the pot, look down at the ground, and use the slot as a precise reference point.
