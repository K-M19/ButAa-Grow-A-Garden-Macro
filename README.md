> [!WARNING]  
> With version V2.0, the macro now operates smoothly with almost any screen resolution. However, I strongly recommend using HD resolution or higher (1280Ã—720). The macro itself will run using a window at 800x600 resolution for optimal performance.

###
- The macro is simply a tool for idle Buy Seeds.  
- The macro is currently in beta, in its Dev version.  
- Any risks involved are your responsibility.  

## Considerations
- This is an idle tool to help you AFK overnight or while working.   
- I am not responsible for any issues that arise from using the macro.  
- Using this tool is entirely your choice and responsibility.  

## Read This Before Using
- Please run the game in full screen mode before using macros.
- The first time run the macro will (Access Denied), it will ask you to look at (config.ini) because that is where you set up the macro so that the macro understands what it should do.
- Run the macro with admin privileges to ensure it always gets priority.  
- Disable Windows Defender if necessary, or add the macro and its folder to the trusted or whitelist section in Windows Defender or other antivirus software.  
- Play Roblox in windowed mode and always open Roblox before starting the macro to help it correctly detect your game window.  
- You don't need to download AutoHotKey to run macros, just run the software directly.

## Virus Detection & DRM(Bitraven)
- First of all, I often receive complaints and questions about this issue, most of which are along the lines of: *"Is your software a virus?"*   
- DRM(Bitraven),Maybe windows will detect the software protected by Bitraven as a virus because I focus on information security of data ".ExE or Script or open executable files like .btrv", it focuses on not being analyzed by other software or software that intends to analyze and dissect deep into the core of the software or software protected by Bitraven, so it will always be detected by windows or anti-virus software, I think this is the best way to protect my personal software from being scrutinized or cracked, there is nothing more fun than creating personal software that ensures safety for everyone but is considered a virus :C "sometimes it is a monument of honor to be considered that :D"
